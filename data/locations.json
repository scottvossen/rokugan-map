The practice came to public notice when the Emperor and his court happened to attend one while traveling through the Crane lands. The Emperor enjoyed the event tremendously, and it soon became a topic of conversation throughout the Empire. In very short order, the tournament-style gempukku ceremony hosted at Tsuma became hugely popular and prestigious, and many clans and families solicited the Crane for the right for their young samurai to attend and compete.</p> <p>In the centuries since, Tsuma and its dojo have increased dramatically in size and the gempukku ceremony hosted in the city has become the most prestigious in all of Rokugan, with all clans sending their best and brightest to participate. Each winner of the tournament is declared the Topaz Champion, holding the title until the next year. Often the Champion is appointed a prestigious position in the Emerald Magistrates or another branch of the Imperial bureaucracy. Although the Emperor does not attend every spring, one or more of the Emperor&rsquo;s Chosen is almost always present.</p>"

The reason for the village&rsquo;s secrecy is that many of its inhabitants are of mixed blood &ndash; they have Yobanjin blood somewhere in their immediate ancestry. Although contact between the Empire and the barbarian tribes to the north is rare and officially prohibited, occasional parties do range through the Great Wall of the North and into the northernmost regions of the Empire, leading sometimes to individuals such as those who dwell within Yobanjin Mura. For their part, the half-bloods of Yobanjin Mura feel somewhat blessed that the Phoenix have allowed them their own village far from the scorn of others, where they are left to their own devices. The only thing required of them in return is to maintain a modest level of trade with the occasional Yobanjin visitors. This trade is for relatively minor items that can be used in casting or researching spells.</p> <p>The Phoenix who administer the village rationalize the legality of Yobanjin Mura to themselves by pointing out that some of the Yobanjin tribes are descended from outcasts who fled the Empire more than one thousand years ago. This means they are not in fact gaijin, and therefore the Imperial edict forbidding unsanctioned trade with gaijin does not apply.

With the possible exception of some strange structures on the Mantis Islands, Shiro Moto is by far the most unusual construction in the whole of Rokugan. Its large, bulbous spires would be more at home in the strange lands north of the Empire, across the vast desert known as the Burning Sands.</p><p>The castle is a major military installation for the Unicorn Clan. From here emerged the concept of forming the Unicorn military into three armies, the offensive Khol, the defensive Junghar, and the shugenja-intensive Baraunghar. After the defeat of the Dark Moto, this castle becomes the capital of the entire Unicorn Clan, gaining significant political importance. Additionally, the castle is also the center for the worship of the Shi-Tien Yen-Wang, the ancient gaijin gods worshipped by the Moto as the Lords of Death. Initially regarded as blasphemous by the rest of the Empire, the Lords were adopted into the Rokugani cosmology in the mid-twelfth century for services rendered in the name of the Fortunes in Tengoku. In modern times a small but growing sect of Rokugani revere them as lesser Fortunes. The greatest temple and center for learning of the Lords of Death is located within the halls of Shiro Moto.</p>"

Although the Shinjo do not place the same nigh-religious importance upon their steeds as the Utaku, they do regard them with more value and compassion than the other families. The average Shinjo bushi looks upon his horse as an ally or brother more than as a beast of burden. While the Shinjo were the lords of the clan for most of Rokugan's history, shortly after the Clan War in the early twelfth century they were removed from power by the returned Kami, Shinjo herself. She was disgusted by the degree to which the heretical Kolat organization had subverted her family. Although the family has worked hard to purge such influences from its ranks, many in the modern Empire continue to look upon the Shinjo with bias despite the Moto's endorsement of their purity.</p>"

In addition to the actual castle itself, the estate includes a rather extensive barracks and training facility as part of the compound, which is where many young samurai honored with an appointment as Emerald Magistrates are brought. Small units from within the Imperial Legions are also trained here, but for the most part such things are reserved for another site specific to Legion training elsewhere.

The city has changed hands countless times between the two clans, each bloodier and more costly than the last, but the city&rsquo;s possession has often been a matter of honor. Both the Lion and the Crane have historical records that indicate they are the rightful administrators of the city, and no arbitration or mediation has ever been able to determine which account is correct. Countless heroes have been made and died in the sacking or defense of the city, and it is littered with shrines to the thousands who have died within its confines. After the destruction of Otosan Uchi at the hands of the Shadowlands, a rare moment of cooperation between the Lion and Crane Champions resulted in Toshi Ranbo becoming the new Imperial City. It was host to the reign of Emperor Toturi III, the final Emperor of the Toturi Dynasty, as well as home to the dawn of the Iweko Dynasty shortly thereafter. Following the city&rsquo;s appointment, massive construction began to accommodate the presence of the Imperial families and the many private estates and embassies that sprung up around it, doubling the city&rsquo;s size almost overnight. It is now one of the largest cities in the Empire, rivaled only by Ryoko Owari and the sprawling port city surrounding Kyuden Gotei.</p>"

Prior to that the Rokugani had buried their dead, but the battle with the Bloodspeaker Iuchiban in the Imperial City changed that. Neither the Emperor nor his subjects desired to see their ancestors re-animated and used as shock troops for a blood sorcerer. The region now called the Fields of the Dead was an old graveyard, long since filled to capacity, concealed among the craggy cliffs on an uninhabitable region of coastline north of Otosan Uchi. There were none to pay homage to the shrines there, as the entire graveyard was filled with the bodies of those washed upon shore, victims of pirates and shipwrecks, most of whom were completely unidentifiable and were only buried out of basic respect &ndash; not to mention the fear of angering both Emma-O and Suitengu, the Fortunes of Death and the Sea, respectively. While portions of the graveyard have been utilized by enterprising maho-tsukai over the centuries, the majority of it remains intact and undisturbed, at least until the Spider located it and co-opted it for their use. After that it became a center for the Chuda family to perfect their sacrilegious necromantic arts, and a constant source of undead forces for the Dark Lord to use as he willed.</p>"

These shelters were forgotten with the coming of the Kami, however, as the people of Rokugan either flocked south to join the newborn Empire or fled east to the steppes, where they would become the Yobanjin tribes. The Fingers, as they were called at the time, were forgotten, and remained so for hundreds of years. They were rediscovered purely by accident when agents of the Dark Lord of the Shadowlands stumbled across them while traveling back from the Burning Sands, where they had delivered a message for their lord. When the Dark Lord discovered the Fingers&rsquo; existence, he immediately dispatched a small force to assess and occupy them, hoping to use them as a staging point for attacks against the Empire. Since that time, the Fingers have proven remarkably useful, as their natural geography makes discovery exceptionally unlikely, and the Spider Clan&rsquo;s abilities allow them to hollow out the spires without compromising their integrity.

      "html" : "<p>This natural passage is the principle means of crossing Earthquake Fish Bay. It connects the core Crab provinces with the southernmost Yasuki and Crane holdings, including a number of influential Daidoji estates. As befits its name, the landbridge is only above water during low tide, when it can be crossed quickly and without difficulty (other than the mud and slime of the sea bottom). During high tide, however, it is completely submerged by over twenty feet of water, making any manner of crossing completely impossible. During the high tide it is easily possible for ships to pass across the bridge, and traffic through the region is carefully observed and regulated by the Hida on the western edge and the Daidoji on the eastern shore.</p> <p>The landbridge is a site of unusual cooperation between the Hida and the Daidoji due to a famous incident from centuries ago. The third son of the Crab Champion was grievously wounded and the troops under his command threatened with complete eradication by the attack of powerful oni. He survived because the Daidoji daimyo and his hunting party crossed the landbridge and engaged the demon. The Daidoji lord fought until both he and the demons disappeared beneath the waves, allowing the Crab time to evacuate their wounded lord. After the tide receded, only the Daidoji daimyo's helmet could be found, and ever since the Hida have reverently maintained a shrine to his memory on the western shore of the landbridge.</p>"

The mountains separate the Phoenix Clan provinces from the Imperial City, and mostly lie outside the boundaries of any clan's holdings. The Phoenix have several significant holdings immediately north of the pass, and the Mantis hold sway over the formerly unaligned Dragon's Guard City at the southern end, but there are no major settlements or holdings along the length of the route itself. Perhaps for this reason, they are unsettled and known to be particularly dangerous. The cycle of freezing and thawing of the ice atop the peaks causes frequent landslides, and there have been intermittent reports of goblins and ogres in the area for centuries. Some shugenja theorize there is a hidden breeding ground for these creatures somewhere deep within the caves and valleys of the mountains, but even the most dedicated searches have never been able to locate them.</p>"

The battle raged for seven days, waxing and waning over that period of time, and thousands lost their lives. At the battle&rsquo;s conclusion, the Matsu general faced the Kakita general in personal combat and, although the Matsu was victorious, she succumbed to her wounds only moments later. The honor and sacrifice of the two officers was enough to end the battle, and both clans would later cooperate in erecting a shrine to their memory within the valley.</p>"
